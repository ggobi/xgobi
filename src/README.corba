XGobi has experimental CORBA facilities. CORBA is a high-level
mechanism for communicating dynamically between applications,
potentially on different machines, written in different languages.
While a general interface, it has been tested by controlling and
querying XGobi from R and S4, using the CORBA facilities developed for
those environments.

To install this, you need some additional software. While these requirements appear
significant, they amount to installing CORBA on an entire machine and allows communication
between any CORBA facilities, rather than just XGobi and R/S.

1) Download the Omegahat CORBA facilities
     http://www.omegahat.org/Downloads/Config.tar.gz
   and follow the instructions for installing that.


2) There are two configuration options
     a) edit the Imakefile and ucomment the line
           #define USE_CORBA 1 
        (near the top of the file)
        xmkmf
        make


     b) ./configure --enable-corba
