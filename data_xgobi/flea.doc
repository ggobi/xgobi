There are three species of flea-beetles: Ch. concinna, Ch. heptapotamica,
and Ch. heikertingeri, and 6 measurements on each.
    1 =  width of the first joint of the first tarsus in microns 
        (the sum of measurements for both tarsi).
    2 = the same for the second joint.
    3 = the maximal width of the head between the external edges of the
        eyes in 0.01 mm.
    4 = the maximal width of the aedeagus in the fore-part in microns.
    5 = the front angle of the aedeagus ( 1 unit = 7.5 degrees).
    6 = the aedeagus width from the side in microns.
