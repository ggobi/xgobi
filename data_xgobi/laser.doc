This data came from an investigation of an experimental laser at
Bellcore.  It was a tunable laser, in the sense that both its
wavelength and power output were controllable.

Rotation helped the experimental physicists to characterize the
laser, which turned out not to be a very good one, due to its
unstable operating region.

The variables are:

  If     Ir     power   lambda

If and Ir are currents applied to the front and rear of the laser.
Power and lambda are the output power and wavelength. 

This data initially came to the statistics research group when
Janette Cooper asked Paul Tukey to help her analyze the data
she had collected to describe the laser.
