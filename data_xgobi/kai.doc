As an example, I am plotting the proportions of times the Greek word
"kai" (and) occurs in ten epistles of Paul.  These data are in
E. J. Snell's (1987) book, Applied Statistics: A Handbook of BMDP Analyses,
Chapman Hall, page 22.

I'm using this type of display of quadruples of proportions for 
displaying the performance of test items.   Points correspond to 
probabilities of choosing among item options as a function of various
levels of performance on the test as a whole.
