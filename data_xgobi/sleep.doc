Data from which conclusions  were  drawn  in  the  article  "Sleep  in
Mammals: Ecological and Constitutional Correlates" by Allison, T.  and
Cicchetti, D. (1976), _Science_, November 12, vol. 194,  pp.  732-734.
Includes brain and body  weight,  life  span,  gestation  time,  time
sleeping, and predation and danger indices for 62 mammals.



Variables below (from left to right) for Mammals Data Set:

species of animal

body weight in kg

brain weight in g

slow wave ("nondreaming") sleep (hrs/day)

paradoxical ("dreaming") sleep (hrs/day)

total sleep (hrs/day)  (sum of slow wave and paradoxical sleep)

maximum life span (years)

gestation time (days)

predation index (1-5)
                1 = minimum (least likely to be preyed upon)
                5 = maximum (most likely to be preyed upon)

sleep exposure index (1-5)
                1 = least exposed (e.g. animal sleeps in a
                    well-protected den)
                5 = most exposed

overall danger index (1-5)
                (based on the above two indices and other information)
                1 = least danger (from other animals)
                5 = most danger (from other animals)
