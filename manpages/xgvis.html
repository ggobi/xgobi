 <B>NAME</B>
<br>
  <B>xgvis</B> - interactive multidimensional scaling using xgobi for
  display

<p>
 <B>SYNOPSIS</B>
<br>
  <B>xgvis</B> [<B>-dims</B> n] [<B>-stepsize</B> x] fname

<p>
 <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
<br>
  <I>xgvis</I> is an interactive multidimensional scaling
  (MDS) program that consists of a control panel to
  manipulate the parameters of the MDS stress function and an
  xgobi window for data display.  It can be used either for
  visualization of dissimilarity data, for dimension
  reduction, or for graph layout.  Graph layout is usually
  done in 2D, but xgvis allows layouts in arbitrary
  dimensions, 3D being the default.  It permits missing
  values, which can be used to implement multidimensional
  unfolding.

<p>
  It is used as follows:

<ul>
<li>
    Start up with a user-supplied or random starting configuration.
<li>
    Initiate MDS optimization.  As the optimization algorithm
    does its work, observe both the changing stress
      values and the animated point configuration.
<li>
    Examine the optimized configuration with 3D rotations and
    grand tours and drill-down operations such as labeling and
    linked brushing.
<li>
    Enhance the configuration with glyphs, colors and lines
    for interpretation.
<li>
    Modifiy the dissimilarities, the stress function, and/or
    the configuration by
<ul>
        transforming the dissimilarities
<li>
        choosing weights or cutting extreme dissimilarities
<li>
        restricting MDS to subsets
<li>
        hand editing the existing configuration or
<li>
        selecting a new random configuration
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
 <B>OPTIONS</B>

<p>
<B>-dims</B> n
<br>
Specify n, the dimensionality of the embedding space.
By default, its value is 3.

<p>
<B>-stepsize</B> x
<br>
Specify the initial stepsize; its default value is 0.1.

<p>
 <B>FILES</B>
<br>
  XGVis uses a set of input files with a common root (which
  we'll call <B>fname</B> in the man page) and a suffix.  First, each
  set must contain a file with the suffix .edges, .dat or
  .dist.
<ul>
<li>
  <B>fname.dist</B>
<br>
    Distance matrix: an n x n matrix, with entries separated
    by white space and one row per line.
<li>
  <B>fname.edges</B>
<br>
    Line segments: specifications for the pattern of line
    segments which connect pairs of points.  The file must
    contain at least two numbers per line.  The first two numbers
    represent the row numbers of the two points that should be
    connected.  (This is exactly like the structure of a
    fname.lines file in xgobi.)  In addition, if a third number
    is present, it is taken to be an edge weight.
<p>
    If this line is present and the distance matrix is absent,
    then the distance matrix is computed from it, with each
    edge representing a distance of one.
<li>
  <B>fname.dat</B>
<br>
  <B>fname.pos</B>
<br>
    Starting positions:  an n x p matrix, with entries separated
    by white space and one row per line.
<p>
    If this file is present and a distance file is absent, the
    distance matrix is computed from it.
<li>
  <B>fname.lines</B>
<br>
    Line segments: specifications for the pattern of line
    segments which connect pairs of points.  If this file is
    present, then the edges file is used to create the distance
    matrix but the lines file is used to draw the edges.
</ul>
  Many additional files can be specified.  See the xgobi man
  page for descriptions of <B>fname.col</B> (variable labels),
  <B>fname.row</B> (case labels), <B>fname.colors</B> (glyph colors), and
  <B>fname.linecolors</B> (line colors), in particular.
