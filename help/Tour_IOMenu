Tour I/O Menu

Use this menu to choose among a few different ways to write or
read information about a tour.

Save Coeffs

 Like "Save Coeffs" in "Rotate," this will write into an ascii file the
 coefficients of the current view of the data as a two column matrix.
 The first column contains the X coefficients of all the variables and
 the second contains the Y coefficients. If XGobi is running from within
 S these coefficients will be written out as a vector.

Save History

 Save a tour history.

Read History
