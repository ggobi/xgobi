Parallel Coordinates Plot

The parallel coordinates plot shows a single line (a set of
connected segments) for each case.  Each case is shown using the
color and glyph of the corresponding point in the main plotting
window.

Show cases menu:
  You may either show the line for each case, or you may choose
  to show only the cases you label in Identify.

Variable scales menu:
  Either scale all variables (or variable groups) using a common
  scale, or scale each variable independently.  If a common scale
  is used, tick marks will be drawn on the leftmost axis.

Double buffer:
  In double buffering, drawing is done offscreen, and the final
  drawing is copied to the screen.  This results in much smoother
  transitions, without flicker, but it can be prohibitively slow
  if thousands of lines are being drawn.

Display
  You can choose independently whether to have the points and the
  lines drawn in the case profile window.

  You may also decline to have the vertical coordinates drawn,
  if you find them cluttering the screen.

  Or you may choose to add horizontal gridlines to help you
  in estimating values; this only applies when a common scale
  is used.

Link
  By default, this window is linked to the plotting window for
  brushing and identification.  if you're looking at all profiles
  and you have many many points, you might want to unlink it,
  because it can get quite slow.

Display Missings
  Display missings (or imputed values) or leave them out.  This
  can provide an interesting view of the distribution of the
  missing values.
