Terms in Expansion or Window Width scrollbar

There are two types of indices currently implemented.  One type is
based on density estimation using expansions in orthogonal polynomials,
and the other is based on kernel density estimations.  In each of these
methods there is a parameter which it is desirable to alter from time
to time.  The second scrollbar allows the interactive changing of these
parameters.  For the polynomials it controls the number of terms used
in the expansions.  For the kernel density estimation it controls the
window width of the kernel.

To control the scrollbar, position the cursor about where you'd like
the new number of terms in the expansion (or window width) to be, then
click the left or middle mouse button.  You can also move the cursor
with the mouse button held down to adjust the number of terms in the
expansion (or window width) interactively.

For finer control, click left on one of the arrows at either end of the
scrollbar.
