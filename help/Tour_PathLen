Tour Path Length Choices

The fraction of geodesic distance between two basis planes completed
can be changed adjusted between 1/10-infinity. The smaller the length
the more often the tour will change paths, so this is useful for
scanning the local neighbourhood of a plane. When the path length is
infinity the tour will continue the current direction indefinitely.
