Save Coeffs: save rotation coefficients in a file

This operation allows a user to save the coefficients of rotation in
use at that moment.

If you select this button, rotation pauses and a window pops up that
asks you to type in a file name.  (You must position the cursor inside
the box in the lower right of the popup window to have your typing
acknowledged.) You can erase typed characters using whatever delete or
backspace operation you are used to. When you have entered the file
name, hit return.

If XGobi is initiated from the shell, the coefficients are written as
two columns, where the first column contains the coefficients of the
variables plotted on the horizontal axis and the second column those
on the vertical.  (This is true whichever axis type is selected.)

If XGobi is initiated within S, the coefficients are written out as a
vector.  (This vector can be transformed into a matrix using the
following S command: t(array(coefs, c(2, ncols))), where coefs is the
vector of coefficients and ncols is the number of columns in the
current data matrix.)

Behavior of the "Solicit File Name" window:

 The editing behavior in this window follows emacs conventions.
 These instructions may help you if you aren't familiar with emacs:
   Use the cursor to position the caret between two letters;
   as you type, characters are entered at that position.
   You can use your customary backspace character.
   Use "Control-k" to delete all characters from the caret
   to the end of the line.
