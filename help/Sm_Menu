Smoother Menu

There are two types of smoothers implemented: mean and median.

These do the smoothing in two ways. One is by using a fixed window
width and step size (all points in the sliding window are used), and
the other by using a fixed number of points (computation is done on a
sliding window of the next x number of points).
