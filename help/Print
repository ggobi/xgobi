Save the contents of the plotting window in a postscript file or send
it directly to a postscript printer, after making some color adjustments
if they are needed.

Use the "Filename" text entry window to specify a filename or the
"Postscript printer" window to specify a printer, then select "Write
to file" or "Send to printer" from the buttons at the bottom of the
print popup.

Some facility for color adjustment has been provided.  Many people
use XGobi with a dark background because that seems to highten the
sense of depth in a multidimensional plot.  When printing, however,
we want to print dark points on a light background.  Defaults are
provided to handle that conversion, and the resulting postscript file
should print successfully either on a color or a monochrome printer.

The set of adjustments is not yet complete:  if you are using a color
workstation, for instance, and some of your points are yellow, then
those points will vanish when you produce a black and white plot:
they will be converted to white and disappear on a white background.
