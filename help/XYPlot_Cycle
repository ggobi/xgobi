Cycle

Selecting the "Cycle" button will start XGobi cycling through the
two-variable plots.  You can select "Fix X" or "Fix Y" to force one of
the axes to be held constant, or you can fix neither, in which case the
plots will cycle over all Y variables for the current X, and then move
to the next X, and so forth.

The 'p' key turns cycling on and off, as well as toggling Pause
in the rotation modes.

The scrollbar allows control of the delay between plots:  moving the
scrollbar to the right will shorten the delay.

To control the scrollbar, position the cursor about where you'd like
the new delay to be, then click the left or middle mouse button.  You
can also move the cursor with the mouse button held down to adjust the
delay interactively.

Change Direction

Click on this button to change the direction of the cycling:  that is,
the next X or Y variable to be plotted is either the one before or the
one after the currently plotted variable.
