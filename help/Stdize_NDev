Deviation

This scrollbar affects the second two data standardization
methods.  It controls the number of deviations (either standard
deviation or median absolute deviation) in the denominator.

To control the scrollbar, position the cursor about where you'd
like the new deviation to be, then click the left or middle
mouse button.  You can also move the cursor with the mouse
button held down to adjust the deviation interactively.

For finer control, click left on one of the arrows at the ends
of the scrollbar.
