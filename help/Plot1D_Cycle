Cycle

Selecting the "Cycle" button will start XGobi cycling through the
one-variable plots.

The scrollbar allows control of the delay between plots:  moving the
scrollbar to the right will shorten the delay.

To control the scrollbar, position the cursor about where you'd like
the new delay to be, then click the left or middle mouse button.  You
can also move the cursor with the mouse button held down to adjust the
delay interactively.

The 'p' key turns cycling on and off, as well as toggling Pause
in the rotation modes.

Change Direction

Clicking on this button changes the direction of the cycle:  that is,
the next variable to be plotted is either the one before or the one
after the currently plotted variable.
