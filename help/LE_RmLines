Delete

Click here to enable the interactive deletion of connecting line
segments.  As you move the cursor in the plot window, the nearest line
segment is highlighted by being drawn boldly.  When the segment you
want to delete is highlighted, click left.

If you realize that you didn't want to delete that point after all,
then click middle and it will be restored.
