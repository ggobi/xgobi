Add axes to plot

  Highlight to display plotting axes.

  This can be set in the XGobi resource file.  The default is

Center axes in 3D+ modes

  In rotation and the tour modes, turning this option
  on causes the axes to be displayed in the lower left
  corner instead of at the plot center.

  It has no effect on Plot1D or XYPlot.

Plot the points

  Display the points.

  This can be set in the XGobi resource file.  The default is
    *showPoints:   True

Plot the lines

  Display the connected line segments.  By default,
  those line segments connect the first point in the
  datafile to the second, the second to the third, etc.

  This value can be set in the XGobi resource file.  The default is
    *showLines:   False

Carry variables between views

  If this entry is off, then each of the viewing modes has its own
  idea of which variables it is plotting, and is not influenced by
  variable selection actions occurring in the other modes.  If it
  is on, an attempt is made to establish continuity of selected
  variables between modes.  For example, if you select a particular
  three variables in Rotate, then move to Grand Tour, the Grand Tour
  will begin with those same three variables.

  This can be set in the XGobi resource file.  The default is
    *carryVars:   False
