Plotting window

In the center of the XGobi window is the plotting window.  In some
XGobi modes, there are a few words of instruction displayed above it.
These instructions describe the mouse operations that are effective
within the plotting window while that mode is selected.

See the documentation for Brush, Scale, and Identify in the main
command panel for further information.

The partitioning of the space between the control panels, the plot
window, the variable selection panel can be made by positioning the
cursor above the little rectangles (called grips) that are at the
bottom of the lines separating these regions, then pressing one of the
mouse buttons and moving the cursor to the left or right.  If this
still doesn't result in a good division of space between the plot
window and the variable selection panel, you might want to adjust
the height and width of PlotWindow or VarPanel using your XGobi
resource file.

These are the defaults you might find useful for tailoring the
PlotWindow to your specifications
