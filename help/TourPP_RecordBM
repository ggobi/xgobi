Record Bitmap

When Record Bitmap is on it is possible to select a bitmap in the
projection pursuit window by clicking within its square with the
left or middle mouse button, and the coefficients that generated
it are recorded into a file.

If either Record Bitmap or Return to Bitmap is on, the cursor in
the projection pursuit window is drawn as a crosshair; when
neither is on, the cursor is an arrow.

The format used is the same as that for tour history so that this
file may be read back into the tour backtracking facility. This
is useful for examining more closely the relationship between
projections corresponding to local maxima of a projection pursuit
index.

Note that the coefficients written out are for sphered data so to
use the facility properly when the file is read into the
backtrack facility PrnComp Basis should be turned on. In
addition, the active variables must be the same in each
instance.
