Jitter 

Degree of jitter
  This scrollbar controls the degree of jitter; that is,
  how widely spread are the jittered points.

Rejitter
  Each time this is clicked, a new random jittering is performed.

Uniform or Normal
  Jittering can either be uniform or univariate normal.

Jitter vgroup
  If you defined a .vgroups file as part of your input data, then
  you have the option whether it should be used here or not.

  The .vgroups file is used to force some set of variables to have
  the same axes and to be transformed together.  They could also be
  jittered together here.

  The .groups file is a single row containing an integer for each
  variable in the data matrix.  If variables are to be grouped together,
  give them the same integer.
