Case List

The case list allows a user a different interface for identification.

Click the *left* button in the case list to highlight a single case
label.  That point will then be labelled in the plotting window.
Drag the left button slowly to cycle through the cases.

Persistent Labels

  Select this to make the labels 'sticky.'

You can also click on `Select All' or `Deselect All' to
select/deselect faster than you would be able to using the mouse.
