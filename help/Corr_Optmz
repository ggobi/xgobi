Optimz

When this button is selected, the correlation tour is following the
gradient of the projection pursuit index to find more interesting
2-dimensional views of the data.

When the guided tour obtains a maximum, it may turn itself off. It does
this when the derivatives are all within a tolerance level of zero,
meaning a better new direction cannot be found. To turn the tour back
on you need to turn "Optimz" off.

When this button is not selected, the projection pursuit index is
still being plotted, but the guided tour is not taking place.  Instead
the viewer is watching a correlation tour with new directions being
chosen at random.
