Help 

To use XGobi's online help, position the cursor inside the control
or window about which you'd like information, then click right.  If
information is available for the control (or widget, in X terminology)
that you selected, you will be asked to position a help window for that
control. 

If the information more than fills the screen of the help window,
use the left or middle mouse button to scroll the window.

You can leave the help window in place for future reference while you
continue to work with XGobi.

Note:
Online help is available for pushbuttons, scrollbars, the variable
selection panel, and the plotting window; it's not available for
labels.
