Color Menu: choose a brushing color

Press and hold on the menu button, then drag the mouse and
release when the label for the color you want is highlighted.

The Color Menu is only active if you are using hardware
that supports color.

The brushing colors can be set in the XGobi resource file.
The defaults are:

  *brushColor0: Red

  *brushColor3: Orange
  *brushColor4: YellowGreen
  *brushColor5: HotPink
  *brushColor6: SkyBlue
  *brushColor7: SlateBlue
  *brushColor8: Orchid
  *brushColor9: Peru

The available colors can be found by executing the X command
xcolors.

See the help file for the brushing I/O menu for information
about supplying point glyph, point color and line color
data in startup files.
