Plot1D

In this plotting mode, the selected variable is displayed in one
of two ways:

  1) as a vertical strip chart, like a jittered dot plot.  The method
     used is described in "Strips Displaying Empirical Distributions:
     I. Textured Dot Strips" by John Tukey and Paul Tukey.

  2) as an average shifted histogram (ASH), as designed by David W.
     Scott.  The ASH has a smoothness parameter, which is the ratio
     of the number of shifted histograms to the number of bins.

This view can be activated from the keyboard by typing d or D.
