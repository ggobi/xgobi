Reshape brush btwn modes

If this is on, then each time you enter the Brush mode,
the brush will be redrawn as a small rectangle in the
upper left corner of the plotting window.  If it is off,
any adjustments you made to the shape and position of
the brush will be retained.

This can be set in the XGobi resource file.  The default is

*reshapeBrush:   True
