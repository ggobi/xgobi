Speed scrollbar

Like the speed scrollbar in Rotate, this scrollbar allows the apparent
speed of the grand tour to be adjusted.

To control the scrollbar, position the cursor about where you'd like
the new speed to be, then click the left or middle mouse button.  You
can also move the cursor with the mouse button held down to adjust the
speed interactively.
