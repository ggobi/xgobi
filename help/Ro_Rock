Rock

While the plot is rotating, selecting Rock causes the rotation to
change direction after each ten subsequent replots.  During rocking,
increasing the speed using the scrollbar causes the angle described by
the rocking motion to be wider.

The states set by the Rock and Interpolate buttons are mutually
exclusive, that is, selecting one causes the other to be 'deselected.'
