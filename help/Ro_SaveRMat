Save or Read Rotation Matrix:  save or read in a 3x3 rotation matrix

This operation allows a user to save the rotation matrix in
use at that moment -- but only if oblique axis rotation is
selected.
  
If you select this button, rotation pauses and a window pops up that
asks you to type in a file name.  (You must position the cursor inside
the box in the lower right of the popup window to have your typing
acknowledged.) You can erase typed characters using whatever delete or
backspace operation you are used to. When you have entered the file
name, hit return.

If XGobi is initiated from the shell, the rotation matrix is written
as a three-column matrix.
    
If XGobi is initiated within S, the matrix is written out as a
vector.  (This vector can be transformed into a matrix using the
following S command: array(rmat, c(3, 3)), where rmat is the
vector created by XGobi.)

Behavior of the "Solicit File Name" window:

 The editing behavior in this window follows emacs conventions.
 These instructions may help you if you aren't familiar with emacs:
   Use the cursor to position the caret between two letters;
   as you type, characters are entered at that position.
   You can use your customary backspace character.
   Use "Control-k" to delete all characters from the caret
   to the end of the line.
