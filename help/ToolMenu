Tools Menu

Each of these buttons opens some window or panel.

Hide or exclude 

Smooth ...
  Add smoothed curves to the current view in the plotting window.

Subset Data ...
  Subset the data in five different ways.

Jitter ...
  Jitter the data in the plotting window.

Graphical inference ...
  Under construction.

Parallel Coordinates Plot ...
  Open a parallel coordinates plot (called the case profile
  in earlier releases of XGobi).  You could either show all
  profiles -- that is, parallel coordinates for all cases --
  or you could use the fact that this plot is linked to
  identification so that you can see the par coords plot for
  any set of variables you specify in the Identify view.

Clone XGobi
  Generate a new XGobi process containing a replicate of
  the current one, as identical as we can make it.

Scatterplot matrix 
  Generate a new XGobi process containing a scatterplot matrix
  of the currently selected variables.

Variable List ...
  Open a list of variables which can be used to define the
  variables that are used in the parallel coordinates plot.
  
Case List ...
  Open a list of cases which provides another method for
  labelling points in the plotting window.

Launch Missing Data XGobi ...
  For data with missing values, start a new XGobi process
  containing jittered zeroes and ones, representing the presence
  and absence of measured data.

  Missing data can be provided to XGobi either by setting missings
  to na (or NA) in the data file, or by supplying a fname.missing
  file in which 1=missing and 0=present.

Impute Missing Values ...
  For data with missing values, the imputation control panel.
