Return To Bitmap

When Return To Bitmap is on, clicking with the left or middle
button on a bitmap in the projection pursuit window forces the
tour to return to this view and to pause.  Turn off the Pause
button to restart the tour.  (The 'p' key turns Pause on and off.)

If either Record Bitmap or Return to Bitmap is on, the cursor in
the projection pursuit window is drawn as a crosshair; when
neither is on, the cursor is an arrow.

If Optimz is on the facility is not available.
